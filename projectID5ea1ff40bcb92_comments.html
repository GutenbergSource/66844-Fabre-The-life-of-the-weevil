<HTML><BODY>How can you write a full length book on the weevil, a tiny long-snouted type of beetle, which most people will hardly notice. If any one can do it, it is Jean-Henri Fabre, the French entomologist who wrote 10 large tomes filled with details of the lifes of insects. Many books could be filled with the trouble they cause to farmers, as major pests they have consumed significant parts of harvests, and are second to none but grasshoppers (about which Fabre also wrote a book) in that respect.

<p>The book itself is not hard, a couple of footnotes, some Latin names, so have fun!
